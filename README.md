# did_snmm
Code and data for applications from Structural Nested Mean Models Under Parallel Trends Assumptions

Apologies, this code is messy! I will work on making this neater over time. I'm also working with a much better programmer to make an R package to implement these methods.

did_snmm_bank is a zipped folder containing R code and data used for the bank deregulation analyses in the paper. It was previously analyzed by Favara and Imbs (2015) and Chaisemartin and D'haultfoueille (2021). 

did_snmm_flood contains code for analyzing the dataset from Gallagher (2015). The data itself is too large to fit on github but can be obtained from IPCSR: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113898/version/V1/view

did_snmm_simulation.R contains code for a simulated example using machine learning for the nuisance models.
